# Travel Packing List App

A simple and user-friendly travel packing list application that helps users manage their packing items. You can add, delete, and mark items as packed, with the data being stored in local storage so it's available even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- Add items to your packing list.
- Mark items as packed/unpacked.
- Delete items from the list.
- Sort items by:
  - Input order
  - Description
  - Packed status
- Clear the entire list.
- Data persistence using **LocalStorage**.

## Technologies Used

- **React** for the frontend.
- **LocalStorage** for data persistence.
- **CSS** for responsive styling.
- **Vercel** for deployment.

## How It Works

- **Add Items**: Input an item's description and add it to the list.
- **Toggle Packed Status**: Click an item to mark it as packed or unpacked.
- **Sorting**: Sort items by different criteria like input order, description, or packed status.
- **Clear List**: Use the "Clear List" button to remove all items after confirming.
- **LocalStorage**: The app automatically stores your list in local storage, so your items persist across reloads.
